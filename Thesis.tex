Your sharp sense of research direction, great enthusiasm, and strong belief in the potential of this research has been a tremendous force for the completion of this work. I have learned so many things from you, including the research work process, writing papers, giving talks, and many more. Most importantly, I thank you for encouraging me in each step of my growing path. Your strong belief in me and continuous encouragement have made this research such an exciting experience that our collaboration finally produces something that we are both proud of.
