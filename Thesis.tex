\section*{Acknowledgments}

Many thanks to my advisor, Dr Chadi Barakat for guiding me, for his creative ideas and for taking me in on short notice and for the valuable advice and direction he gave me while finishing my dissertation. Thank you also to Dr Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos who always demonstrated a clear ideal for doing good research.
Thank you to my fellow peers who have taught me and encouraged me.

Finally, I owe much of my perseverance to parents and my fiancee Meriem who always kept my thoughts positive.
