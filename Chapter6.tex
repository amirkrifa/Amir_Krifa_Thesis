In this chapter we present the design of MobiTrade, our architecture for opportunistic
collaborative content dissemination. We start by giving a high level overview of the system
and its design principles in~\ref{MobiTradeArchitecture}. Then we present the actual design and implementation
in Section~\ref{MobiTradeDesignAndImplementation}. We describe a set of initial functionalities that we implement as an Android mobile application on top of MobiTrade architecture in Section~\ref{MobiTradeCurrentFunctionalities}. We conclude the chapter with a discussion of the open issues and a summary in Section~\ref{MobiTradeSoftSummary}.


\section{MobiTrade Architecture Overview}
\label{MobiTradeArchitecture}

\subsection{MobiTrade Device Model}
\label{MobiTrade-node}

Having described the various MobiTrade algorithms in chapter~\ref{chapter:PTMP}, we give here some more details of the MobiTrade device architecture. Figure~\ref{MobiTrade-node-architecture} is a schematic of the core MobiTrade device, which has five building blocks. We have  implemented this architecture on Android phones in order to conduct small scale tests/experiments.

The \textit{Application Interface} is designed so that developers can easily extend MobiTrade and create new content sharing applications that use the MobiTrade functionalities. Each MobiTrade application has a unique ID that it registers at the application interface. The application then simply communicates with the MobiTrade system using event handlers.

The \textit{Scheduling Block} defines the order to follow while forwarding a set of requested contents within a limited contact opportunity. As explained before, this ordering is done based on the utility values.

The \textit{Tit-For-Tat Trading and Forwarding Block} takes in charge \emph{(i)} the forwarding of the stored channels records whenever a new contact is established, and \emph{(ii)} the negotiation and forwarding of the requested contents.

The \textit{Content/Channel Management Block} manages the channel and content storage space. It provides an API for storing and retrieving channel and content records that hides the storage technology specifics. This block also takes in charge utility updates for the stored channels and buffer management (as described in Section~\ref{buffer-management}).

The \textit{Link Controller Block} is the lowest layer in the MobiTrade architecture. It provides a common interface for sending and receiving data across the different available wireless interfaces. It is also responsible for periodically scanning the neighborhood for devices, for establishing the contacts whenever meeting opportunities arise and for triggering the Tit-For-Tat trading and forwarding block. The link controller provides an API that hides network technology specifics (Bluetooth and Wi-Fi) from the rest of the upstream blocks.


\section{Design and Implementation}
\label{MobiTradeDesignAndImplementation}

We have implemented MobiTrade in Java for the Google Android OS platform. Our implementation is based on Bluetooth but we also intend to support the 802.11 in ad-hoc mode in the future. The current Android Java libraries do not currently support the ad-hoc mode of 802.11 although this is supported by both the driver and the hardware interface on the HTC Desire device. Therefore, making our implementation supporting the ad-hoc mode requires the device to be run in privileged user mode (i.e. rooted mode) so that the interface can be reconfigured to run in ad-hoc mode.



\subsection{An Overview of Bluetooth}

Bluetooth is a low-power short-range wireless communication technology intended to replace the cables connecting electronic devices. Below we give a short 
overview on the Bluetooth protocol stack, the device discovery procedure (called inquiry scan in Bluetooth terminology), supported higher 
layer protocols and application programming interfaces.

Bluetooth operates on a license-free ISM band at 2.4GHz (the same as used by 802.11). The physical layer is based on frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS)
and transmits data on up to 79 frequency bands (1 MHz each). Each frequency band is divided into time slots and full duplex transmission is provided through the use of
a time-division duplex (TDD) scheme.

Bluetooth network has a master-slave structure. A master device can communicate with up to seven devices forming a so called piconet. In a piconet devices communicate
on the same physical channel that is defined by a common clock (set by the master) and a frequency hopping pattern. By definition, the device that initiates a connection
becomes the master. Once a piconet has been established, master-slave roles may be exchanged. At any given time, data can be transferred between the master and one
other device, but never directly between two slaves. A device can only be synchronized to a single channel at a time. Multiple simultaneous operations (e.g. partici-
pating in various piconets, being discoverable and connectable) are supported using time-division multiplexing between various channels. However, device can only be
the master of a single piconet.

Above the physical layer in the architecture there is a number of logical links for control and data traffic. These are managed by a L2CAP layer that provides a channel based abstraction for applications. One logical (and physical) link can thus carry data for multiple applications. L2CAP provides reliable transmission performing flow
control, CRC checks and retransmissions upon request. The main traffic services provided are asynchronous connection-oriented unicast and isochronous constant rate
channel (e.g. for audio streaming). However, these channels are rarely used directly by applications, instead several higher layer protocols have been standardized and
implemented in various client libraries (see below). 

The most commonly adopted Bluetooth specifications include v1.2, v2.0 and v2.1 all being backwards compatible. The specifications differ mainly in supported bit rates and support for some advanced features. The nominal rate for Bluetooth v1.2 is 1Mbit/s. Bluetooth v2.0 increases the bit rate up to 2Mbit/s (Basic Rate) and 3Mbit/s (Enhanced Data Rate or EDR). v2.1 extends the inquiry responses (more on this below) and adds secure pairing among other minor tweaks. The operational
ranges of Bluetooth devices vary from approximately 1, 10 to 100 meters (class 3, class 2 and class 1 respectively). Smartphones are generally class 2 devices.

\paragraph*{Inquery Scan Procedure}

The Bluetooth specification defines two separate physical channels for device discovery (inquiry scan channel) and connection setup (page scan channel). 
Each Bluetooth devices can be in one of the four states: (1) connectable and discoverable, (2) connectable, (3) discoverable, or (4) neither discoverable nor connectable. A device
cannot be discovered nor connected unless it is configured in the correct state.

A discoverable device listens for inquiry requests periodically (called inquiry scan state) on its inquiry scan channel that has a reduced number of hop frequencies and a
slower rate of hopping. In order to discover neighboring devices, an inquiring device hops through all possible inquiry scan channel frequencies in a pseudo-random
 fashion, sending an inquiry request on each frequency and listening for responses. This is done at a faster rate, allowing the inquiring device to cover all inquiry scan 
 frequencies in a reasonably short time period. The Bluetooth specification recommends an inquiry duration of 10.24s. Then, with high probability, all neighboring devices will
have entered their inquiry scan state and will hear the inquiry.

An inquiry response consists of an unique 48-bit device address of the discovered device and a 24-bit Class-of-Device code (CoD). The CoD consists of a major and 
minor device codes. The device codes are standardized and provide information about the device type: major code can tell if the device is a computer or a phone for 
example while the minor code can specify if the device is a cellular or cordless phone. In addition, each device may have a human readable name that can be queried using
a separate control request. The extended inquiry response available in v2.1 can provided the human readable name and additional information about supported services
directly in the inquiry response. Older Bluetooth devices must use the separate control request and a service discovery protocol (see below) instead.

Once a device is discovered, a connection setup can take place. A connectable device is listening on its page scan channel for connection requests that are send in a
similar fashion as inquiry scans. The connection setup must be completed before any data can be transmitted between the devices.

\paragraph*{Higher Layer Protocols}

Each Bluetooth device must support the Service Discovery Protocol (SDP). The service discovery mechanism provides the means for client applications to discover
the existence of services provided by server applications as well as the attributes of those services. The attributes of a service include the type or class of the service and
the protocol information needed to access the service. The SDP protocol itself is run by a SDP server on the device that is responsible of maintaining the local service records
and answering service discovery queries for SDP clients on other Bluetooth devices.

The Bluetooth specifications define various specialized protocols on top of the L2CAP layer for different purposes such as audio streaming, telephony and data
transmissions. The most commonly used serial data stream protocol is RFCOMM. The RFCOMM protocol provides emulation of serial ports (up to 60 ports can be used
simultaneously depending on the implementation). It provides a simple reliable data stream service, similar to TCP. In order to connect to another Bluetooth device over
RFCOMM, the client must know the server channel which can be resolved using SDP. It is also possible to use hard-coded channels, but dynamic channel numbers are 
recommended since the number of available channels is very limited (30).

\paragraph*{Application Programming Interfaces}

The main interface between user level applications and the Bluetooth device is
called Host Controller Interface (HCI) that is standardized in the Bluetooth specification. However, existing Bluetooth protocol stack implementations typically do not
allow direct access to the HCI interface but provide their own abstractions of the main Bluetooth operations. The main stacks in use include BlueZ for Linux based devices 2 ,
Windows Bluetooth stack and WinSock for Windows and Windows CE based devices 3 and Broadcom's Bluetooth stack for Windows based devices 4.

The client APIs let the applications control the device state (discoverable and/or connectable), the human readable Bluetooth device name and very often the CoD
value. The device inquiry can be initiated at anytime through the Bluetooth API and the applications can typically control the duration of the inquiry and/or the number of
responses to wait for. The applications can also query for the human readable names of the discovered devices, create local SDP records for the services they provide and
query the records of nearby devices. The data services such as RFCOMM are typically accessed using a special type of socket and the familiar socket API.

\section{Current Available Functionalities}
\label{MobiTradeCurrentFunctionalities}

The current Android implementation of MobiTrade provides to the user a simplified dashboard (see Figure~\ref{dashboard}) from which he can both follow and interact on real time with the MobiTrade daemon. Indeed, the user have access to the current device Bluetooth state (whether the adapter is on or off, whether it is in discoverable mode or not and whether the device is currently running a discovery session or not). A set of statistics are also presented within the dashboard like the total number of contents stored within the device, the \% of used space with respect to the total space allocated to the MobiTrade application, the total number of channels maintained within the system, how much among the latter ones the user requested locally and finally the number of Bluetooth discovered devices that run MobiTrade.
 
\begin{figure}[!h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2in,height=3in]{Chapitre6/Dashboard.png}
\end{center}
\caption{MobiTrade dashboard.}
\label{dashboard}
\end{figure}

In terms of functionalities, from within the dashboard depicted in Figure~\ref{dashboard}, the user is able to control the device Bluetooth discoverability, to control 
the Bluetooth discovery session, to manage channels (create new ones or join existing ones) and contents (create new contents or publish existing ones). We details in the following paragraphs the latter functionalities.

\paragraph{Bluetooth Interface Management}

One of the limitations that we faced along the implementation of MobiTrade was related to the Android Bluetooth stack. Indeed, there
was no way to keep the mobile device discovrable to other non paired devices for more than 300 seconds. Enabling discoverability is necessary for MobiTrade to host a server socket that will accept incoming connections, because the remote non paired devices must be able to discover the device before it can initiate the connection. According to the Android SDK, by default, enaibling discoverablity makes the device discoverable for $120$ seconds. The Android SDK provides a way to define a different duration by adding the \emph{EXTRA\_DISCOVERABLE\_DURATION} Intent extra, however the maximum duration is fixed to 300 seconds.

In order to overcome the latter limitation, we have added a broadcast receiver to MobiTrade to catch Android Bluetooth scan mode changements. Then, whenever the scan mode changes to not discoverable the user is notified, so he can decide wether to re-enable discoverability or not. This is could be done via the Button \emph{"Turn On Discoverable Mode"} provided in the dashboard (see Figure~\ref{dashboard}).

Through the dashboard as well as the configuration tab described in Figure~\ref{Config}, we also provide to the user the control over the Bluetooth discovery sessions. Indeed, by default, whenever MobiTrade does not have a running content sharing session, it launches a Bluetooth discovery session trying to find new sharing opportunities. It is abvious that the latter behaviour maximizes the probability of identifying new MobiTrade devices (sharing opportunities) however it can turn out very quickly to be a useless waste of energy (device battery). Indeed, if the user knows that he gonna be completely physically isolated from any possible sharing opportunity, he can decide to stop temporary the Bluetooth discovery sessions towards saving some energy then, restarted later. To do this, the user should ask MobiTrade to take control over the Bluetooth discovery session by updating the corresponding entry in the configration tab descripbed in Figure~\ref{Config}. Then, the user can drive the discovery from within the dashboard.

\paragraph{Contents Management}

\paragraph{MobiTrade Configuration}

As described in Figure~\ref{Config}, MobiTrade configuration tab provides to the user the possibility to tune some important parameters within the MobiTrade architecture. 

Namely, towards controlling the device resources usage (both local storage as well as battery), first  \emph{(i)} it is made possible for the user to specify the maximum amount of storage space that MobiTrade is allowed to use both for storing locally requested contents as well as contents used for trading. And second \emph{(ii)}, as decribed above in this section, the user can either leverage the control of the Bluetooth discovery sessions to MobiTrade daemon which will try to keep always discovering new sharing opportunities or he can take the control over that process and decide on the moment at which the device should run a discovery session. Following the latter option, the user can save lot of battery power without loosing in terms of revenues from possible sharing opportunities.

\section{Summary and Open Issues}
\label{MobiTradeSoftSummary}
We have described the design and implementation of our system for the Google Android platform. Our experience from the implementation is that Android is a very powerful platform and quite mature despite its young age. The Java based environment provides a familiar environment with good support for most common OS primitives such as threads and concurrency, database and content storage and inter process communication through the Android service binding mechanism. Some features are however still missing, in particular support for the 802.11 ad-hoc mode (which needs to be implemented in native code). We believe that our design is general and facilitates the implementation of 
advanced content-centric applications. There are however some issues that are not, or only partially addressed by our design. We do currently not address particularly the issues of privacy, security and power management.
